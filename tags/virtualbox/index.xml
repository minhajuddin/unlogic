      <description>I just did a apt-get dist-upgrade to bump up to Kali 1.0.7. I&amp;rsquo;ve got it running on VirtualBox, and after it booted back up all the VBoxAddition features were gone and the keyboard and mouse in X no longer worked. GRUB was fine however. Poking around the logs a little I discovered some issues with the mouse driver. Perhaps that was it, but why? Long story short it took quite a bit of digging, but I eventually managed to fix it.</description>
