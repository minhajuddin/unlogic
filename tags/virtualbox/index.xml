      <title>Fixing Kali VM after dist-upgrade</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just did a &lt;code&gt;apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/code&gt; to bump up to Kali 1.0.7.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got it running on VirtualBox, and after it booted back up all the
VBoxAddition features were gone and the keyboard and mouse in X no longer
worked. GRUB was fine however. Poking around the logs a little I discovered
some issues with the mouse driver. Perhaps that was it, but why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short it took quite a bit of digging, but I eventually managed
to fix it. First thing is that the &lt;code&gt;pcscd&lt;/code&gt; group just &lt;em&gt;dissapeared&lt;/em&gt;.
All the following commands assume you are root, otherwise
prefix them with &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;. So I ran&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;groupadd pcscd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to add the group back in. Then run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will take a little while. Once done run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d/vboxadd setup&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it will build the kernel modules for the additons. One more reboot
and you should be back to a working system with all the integration you
had before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea why this happens, but hopefully this post will help you
should you have the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
