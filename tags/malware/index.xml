      <description>I recently got hold of some malware that got snapped up by McAfee and stored in a bup file. Keen to take a look at it, I researched how to &amp;lsquo;unbup&amp;rsquo; files and found this page: http://blog.opensecurityresearch.com/2012/07/unbup-mcafee-bup-extractor-for-linux.html A slow bash script? A faster script in Perl? No, that won&amp;rsquo;t do. Rather than search for a Python implementation I decided to use this as an opportunity to write something, and thus my unbup.py was born.</description>

      <description>I recently setup a dionaea honeypot on my Raspberry Pi and after tweaking and configuring it for a few days have now got a working setup. It&amp;rsquo;s a low interaction honeypot aimed to capture malware rather than ssh bruteforce attacks. I plan to leave it online for a week or a month, and the analyse the stats and see what it managed to collect. So far it&amp;rsquo;s mostly conficker variants, but there&amp;rsquo;s a suprising (to me) large number of infected machines out there.</description>
