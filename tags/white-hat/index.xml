      <description>Another year, another Hacky Easter and a month, of fun, learning, and frustrations. All in all this was another great year and I&amp;rsquo;m already looking forward to 2016&amp;rsquo;s edition. I found this year&amp;rsquo;s challenges were a bit harder than last year, but I did my best. Challenge 01 I&amp;rsquo;m told to search out the password in the following image Taking note of the missing letters and rearranging them to spell HACKERZ I&amp;rsquo;ll enter that into the egg-o-matic and see what happens.</description>
