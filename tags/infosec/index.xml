      <description>Another day, another VM. Today it&amp;rsquo;s the SpyderSec Challenge So let me start it up and get on it. As per usual I need the IP of the machine and the services it has running (if any). Straight from the Unlogic Cookbook root@kali:~/Downloads# nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24 Starting Nmap 6.49BETA4 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2015-09-09 16:07 BST Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.1 Host is up (0.00039s latency).

      <description>The folks over at the Infosec Institue have released their second CTF. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I got on&amp;hellip; Level 01 In level 01 I am supposed to use the provided form to perform a cross site scripting exploit. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the form looks like: At first I might as well test how the form works. Entering something like test and www.test.com in the fields simply adds the supplied information to the column on the left.</description>

      <description>This is my first writeup of a Vulnhub wargame: Freshly. The challenge is: The goal of this challenge is to break into the machine via the web and find the secret hidden in a sensitive file. Go grab the image and follow along. First I need to determine the image&amp;rsquo;s IP address and what services it is running: root@kali:~# nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24 Starting Nmap 6.47 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-04-10 18:19 BST Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.1 Host is up (0.00019s latency).</description>

      <description>The InfoSec Institue is running a n00bsCTF, and I can&amp;rsquo;t resist a CTF really. Plus this will be a nice warmup for Hackyeaster 2015. So let&amp;rsquo;s jump on it and get some flags&amp;hellip; I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to get all of them, but I will be updating this post when I manage to solve some of the others. Level 01 http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/levelone.php May the source be with you, eh? Sounds to me like someone wants us to look at the page source.</description>
