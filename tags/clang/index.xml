      <description>&lt;p&gt;Code completion. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it nice? Especially when you have a so many APIs that you can&amp;rsquo;t always remember EVERY method, member or class name in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vim. Isn&amp;rsquo;t it powerful? The ease and speed with which it allows you to edit your code and do your work is just lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But code completion in vim? Well yes. You can use ctags. Yes, you can make tag files for ALL your APIs and autocompletion works rather well. I did this and the Qt tags file is 1.7GB. So, urm yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s not entirely awesome either. Plus it doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle things like smart pointers, which you will no doubt come across at some stage.&lt;/p&gt;
