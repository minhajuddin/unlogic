      <description>Had this script sitting around for a while and I figured I would clean it up a bit and share it. Get Purplescraper from my Github In short: you give it a starting directory, which will usually be where all the user directories are, and it will go get all .purple/accounts.xml files and extract any usernames and passwords it finds into a new file. Useful to make sure none of your sensitive data is available to other, non authorised users via slack file permissions.</description>
