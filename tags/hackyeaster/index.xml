      <description>I started writing these up as separate posts, but then I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be neater to post them all in one. So here you go, all the Hacky Easter eggs. Some answers will guide you directly to the eggs, others will require a little bit of work to achieve it. But if you got stuck and are wondering where those missing eggs are, I hope this guide will help you. Egg 0x01 - Just for fun The the first egg is fairly easy.</description>
