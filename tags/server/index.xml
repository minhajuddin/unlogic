      <description>This post serves mostly as a &amp;ldquo;note to self&amp;rdquo;. I just ordered myself a super cheap VPS from Ramnode as I have a little project I would like to setup and see if I can make it work. But first I had to setup the server (Debian 7.0) and it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve done that, so some reading was in order to remind myself of all the joys. Thus I decided to note this down for myself and anyone else who&amp;rsquo;s interested.</description>
