      <description>Another day, another VM. Today it&amp;rsquo;s the SpyderSec Challenge So let me start it up and get on it. As per usual I need the IP of the machine and the services it has running (if any). Straight from the Unlogic Cookbook root@kali:~/Downloads# nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24 Starting Nmap 6.49BETA4 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2015-09-09 16:07 BST Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.1 Host is up (0.00039s latency).

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been AFK for a while because of various reasons, but now I&amp;rsquo;m back and have managed to scrape a little time together to get on with some of Vulnhub&amp;rsquo;s new VMs. So let&amp;rsquo;s start with Nullbyte 1 Stage 1 I ran the usual service discovery and found: root@kali:~# nmap -sV 192.168.56.101 Starting Nmap 6.49BETA4 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2015-08-25 11:29 BST Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.101 Host is up (0.00057s latency).</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s what the form looks like: At first I might as well test how the form works. Entering something like test and www.test.com in the fields simply adds the supplied information to the column on the left.</description>
