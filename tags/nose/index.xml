      <description>We all know how important unit testing is, right? But often you wonder how can you test a not so straight forward tool. In this case we&amp;rsquo;re talking about a Python script intended to run inside Houdini. In my specific case the python script is launched from a script on a node when the user clicks a button on the OTL. I want to run unit tests on this script, but the problem is that the script parses a set of nodes and does various things according to the types of nodes and layout of the nodes.</description>
