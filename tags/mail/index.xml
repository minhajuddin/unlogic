      <description>A while back I got curious about how easy it would be to setup a temporary email forwarding service, akin to Meltmail. So I got to it and made it. In essence you will create a temporary email address that will forward all mail it receives to your inbox. Once it expires, it drops all incoming mail. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty much ready now, hence why I am posting about it. The differences between Burnmail (yeah, best I could do for now) and other services is: forwarding can be expired by time or by number of received mails all tasks are accomplished through email.</description>
