      <description>Some time ago, some long, long time ago, I started working on a ray tracer. Yes, you&amp;rsquo;re right, the world doesn&amp;rsquo;t need another ray tracer. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t writing another ray tracer though. I was writing the ray tracer from this book. Well, not line for line, but I was using it for the most part and just adjusting a few things to my liking and style. Initially I started it because I was curious how these things really work under the hood.</description>
