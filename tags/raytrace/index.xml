      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, some long, long time ago, I started working on a ray tracer. Yes, you&amp;rsquo;re
right, the world doesn&amp;rsquo;t need another ray tracer. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t writing another ray tracer though.
I was writing the ray tracer from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raytracegroundup.com/&#34;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;. Well,
not line for line, but I was using it for the most part and just adjusting a few things
to my liking and style. Initially I started it because I was curious how these things
really work under the hood. The principles and concepts of a ray tracer weren&amp;rsquo;t
foreign to me, but to actually implement one, component by component, that was new.
Then the project ground to a halt for what reason(s) I can&amp;rsquo;t recall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So fast forward today and, feeling somewhat ashamed about it, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to revive the project and
post the code on github. Right now I need to make sure the build still works and
that my system has all the dependencies, after that I&amp;rsquo;ll push the code to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Svenito/lemon&#34;&gt;https://github.com/Svenito/lemon&lt;/a&gt; then I&amp;rsquo;ll continue
building on the code from the book, chapter by chapter until, one day, Lemon will be complete.&lt;/p&gt;
