      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of YAGNI but not of TEFNAR. To recap YAGNI stands for You Ain&amp;rsquo;t Gonna Need It and refers to the development principle of that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t write a feature that no one has asked for in the first place as it&amp;rsquo;s probably never going to be needed. Instead wait until it&amp;rsquo;s a requirement and implement it then. This saves wasted effort and keeps the code base clean and as small as possible.</description>
