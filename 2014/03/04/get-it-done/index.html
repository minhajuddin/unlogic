      <article class="post-content">
      <p>A few years ago, during a particularily active developing phase I had an idea for a project.
I toyed with it in my head and thought about issues I might encounter. Will it work
in this situation? Is it something that will be useful? How do I make feature X work?
Do I need it to also do this? The usual stuff. So much so I never got round to starting it.
I figured it&rsquo;s ok, because someone else has done it and executed in a much better way.
Besides, who&rsquo;d want to use it anyway, right? It would only have been me.</p>

<p>So now I am browsing my newsfeed and come across this: <a href="https://flutterapp.com/">https://flutterapp.com/</a></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much what I was aiming to make back then. Just goes to show you doesn&rsquo;t it,
if you have an idea just go make it happen. Just because someone else has made it doesn&rsquo;t
mean you shouldn&rsquo;t make it again if you want. Perhaps you can do it better? We&rsquo;re not all
innovators, but we are all capable to make something different and perhaps better.
If you can&rsquo;t quite figure out how to do it, don&rsquo;t let that stop you from at least making a start.
Do something, anything, to get started. That&rsquo;s the hard part. Once you get started don&rsquo;t force
yourself to make it work in a day, or a week even. Take your time, do it as long as you enjoy it.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to take some of my own medicine and make a start on this project myself. It&rsquo;s been a
long time coming after all.</p>
