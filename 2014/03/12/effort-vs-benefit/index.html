			 	<h1>Effort Vs Benefit</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Wed, Mar 12, 2014</span>
			      <p>How often have you thought: &ldquo;Everything would be a lot better if this
tool worked faster&rdquo;? Probably quite often. You&rsquo;ve most likely also heard the
saying &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t optimise prematurely&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s true, there&rsquo;s no point making
something faster if you don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s too slow. Don&rsquo;t waste time on
trying to optimise before you get some metrics telling you it needs it.</p>

<p>What you might not have thought about though is whether the speed increase
is actually worth it. Sure, for something like game development where
every nanosecond matters it&rsquo;s very critical, but in other situations,
it really depends on how the performance impacts the user&rsquo;s workflow.</p>

<p>A paper from 2011 titles <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rqc3xpmtskxcxov/workflow.pdf">The Workflow Scale</a> covers this subject very well. It is targeted at
a specific industry and workflow, but the same applies elsewhere.
It says that the benefit of a speed increase to a workflow depends on
how it changes the behaviour of the user. It&rsquo;s a short but well
written paper that every developer should read.</p>

<p>I appreciate that it doesn&rsquo;t apply to all cases, but it&rsquo;s information
that should be taken on board. The next time you decide you should spend
some time improving the speed of a certain task, consider if the payoff is
worth the time you will spend making the improvement.</p>
