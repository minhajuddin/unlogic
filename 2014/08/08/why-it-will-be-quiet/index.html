      <article class="post-content">
      <p>If you are reading this in the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pQSJhyw.png">future</a> you might
be wondering why the posts are so old and why there are no recent ones.
The simple reason is that I have had nothing to add. &ldquo;But how did you
know this?&rdquo; you ask. Well, I decided so. I&rsquo;ve not been very good at adding
content recently, for the simple reason that I have nothing much to write about.</p>

<p>You see it&rsquo;s quite simple really: I&rsquo;m taking a step back from it all. I have a
full time job and a family. Both these things are time consuming and that
leaves little time for me to tinker, hack, code, write whatever. So I&rsquo;ve decided
that rather than shoe horn in half-assed attempts, I&rsquo;d rather just take a step
back. Going by the simple idion of
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/8maeRT0.jpg">&ldquo;Anything worth doing, is worth doing right&rdquo;</a>. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I will be giving up coding, hacking, whatever,
completely, it just means I will be working on things that aren&rsquo;t really worth
writing about or that have already been written about a hundered times over.
Thus I will have little or nothing new to add to what is already available <a href="http://www.google.com">out
there</a>.</p>

<p>I could write about things from work, but the nature of my work doesn&rsquo;t really
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/ugA8LLd.gif">allow for that</a>.
I don&rsquo;t want to write about opinions and thoughts, because that&rsquo;s
not what I am about. I&rsquo;ve tried it before and I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it, nor was I
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/Ut25SPN.gif">happy with the result</a>.
So with this I will leave what is here for your reference and who knows,
maybe one day there will be another post about something or other.</p>

<p>Time to kickback and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rSxyNlO.gif">have a beer</a> methinks.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading<a href="https://i.imgur.com/vG96Num.gif">.</a></p>
