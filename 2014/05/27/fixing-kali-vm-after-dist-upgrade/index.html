			 	<h1>Fixing Kali VM after dist-upgrade</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Tue, May 27, 2014</span>
			      <p>I just did a <code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code> to bump up to Kali 1.0.7.
I&rsquo;ve got it running on VirtualBox, and after it booted back up all the
VBoxAddition features were gone and the keyboard and mouse in X no longer
worked. GRUB was fine however. Poking around the logs a little I discovered
some issues with the mouse driver. Perhaps that was it, but why?</p>

<p>Long story short it took quite a bit of digging, but I eventually managed
to fix it. First thing is that the <code>pcscd</code> group just <em>dissapeared</em>.
All the following commands assume you are root, otherwise
prefix them with <code>sudo</code>. So I ran</p>

<p><code>groupadd pcscd</code></p>

<p>to add the group back in. Then run</p>

<p><code>apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)</code></p>

<p>This will take a little while. Once done run</p>

<p><code>/etc/init.d/vboxadd setup</code></p>

<p>And it will build the kernel modules for the additons. One more reboot
and you should be back to a working system with all the integration you
had before.</p>

<p>I have no idea why this happens, but hopefully this post will help you
should you have the same problem.</p>
