<p>As I&rsquo;m just going around and updating the passwords to some of my online accounts, which was prompted by <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.dagensit.no/article2411857.ece">this</a> article, I was wonderingwhat a good password really is. Not just in terms of security but also in terms of user friendliness.</p>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.lastpass.com">Lastpass</a> to manage my passwords and have it auto fill in my credentials on various sites. This works well until I need to manually enter them on another device (iPhone for example - I haven&rsquo;t got a premium subscription yet) or have to type it in just because.</p>

<p>We know that everywhere suggests some wonderfully random characters of at least 8 characters in length and Lastpass actually provides a tool to generate these:</p>

<ul>
<li>k%U94*7r</li>
<li>66ds}9R</li>
<li>9^wtH7xo</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we have some 8 character examples for apparently fairly secure options. Fine. They probably are secure. But do you really want to type those in using a touch keyboard on a phone?</p>

<p>Now here&rsquo;s my suggestion: <strong>Three or more random, unrelated words making one password.</strong>
For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>tarnishedmoleclouds</li>
<li>refriedchutneygarbage</li>
<li>turkeyloadedparasol</li>
</ul>

<p>Those of you who read <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">XKCD</a> should already be on the same page as me. Not only are these more memorable (which if you use a password manager is irrelevant) but also much easier to type in on any type of keyboard. But that&rsquo;s not all. Let&rsquo;s have a look at bruteforce times using <a href="http://www.lockdown.co.uk/?pg=combi">these tables</a></p>

<p>In the first case we have 8 character passwords made up of &ldquo;Mixed upper and lower case alphabet and common symbols.&rdquo;. According to the relevant table (and we are assuming a reasonably competent team of crackers using a <a href="http://www.lockdown.co.uk/?pg=combi#classE">class E</a> attack) these passwords can be cracked in 346days. Not too bad really. But let&rsquo;s see how that compares to &ldquo;The full alphabet, either upper or lower case (not both in this case)&rdquo;. Picking one password from above (refriedchutneygarbage) with 21 characters it would take at least 6.3trillions years to break. Much better. Heck, even with 1000,000,000 guesses per second you&rsquo;re still looking at 631billion years.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say how much of an impact adding/removing spaces has on the timings though - if any one knows, or has any insights, do share in the comments. Is using spaces better, the same, or worse than not using spaces? Theoretically I&rsquo;d imagine that it&rsquo;d be better with spaces as that&rsquo;s an extra character to add to the list.</p>

<h2 id="update:abb71b3d5285572362ebe516c3dc67ed">UPDATE</h2>

<p>Having said the above, it&rsquo;s worth also assuming that any competent cracker will be using wordlists too, and not just brute forcing the password. According to the <a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language">Oxford English Dictionary</a> there are about 140,000 words in use. This number is a bit high as most of us won&rsquo;t know, or use them all. So to get a more realistic number, I&rsquo;ve looked at some common wordlists you can find on the internet and the word count we&rsquo;re looking at is around 50,000 to 70,000.</p>

<p>Given that (as mentioned in the comments) we essentially have a 3 character password with a much larger search space, we can do the math. Three words, 60,000 (taking the middle word count) words will give us 216trillion possibilities. At a rate of 10,000,000 passwords per second it would take around 250 days to crack. Not too shabby still, but not as good as initially hoped, and also worse than your &lsquo;messy&rsquo; passwords.</p>

<p>So my solution to generating secure, but still easily typeable passwords, is to generate 15-20 character long passwords made only of random alphabetical characters rather than words. In this case the figures above will still hold true.</p>

<p>As a quick sampler of a generated password with 16 characters, lowercase only, and pronouncable:</p>

<ul>
<li>alicattervetonstou</li>
<li>molyciontivenzagol</li>
<li>audentophitendowdy</li>
</ul>

<p>harder to remember, harder to crack but still easily typed out even with an onscreen keyboard. The pronounceable part is optional but it might aid in remembering the password better.</p>
