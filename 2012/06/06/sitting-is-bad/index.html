			 	<h1>Sitting is bad</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Wed, Jun 6, 2012</span>
			      <p>So the internet has recently been telling me that sitting is bad. Really bad. Well only if you <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34956099/ns/health-fitness/t/you-sitting-down-experts-say-itll-kill-you/">sit</a> <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/09/sitting-down-infographic/">for</a> <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5800720/the-sitting-is-killing-you-infographic-illustrates-the-stress-of-prolonged-sitting-importance-of-getting-up">long</a> <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110712093859.htm">periods</a> of time. At my office it is very unlikely that they will be willing to furnish me with a standing desk unless my doctor tells them to. The latter also being unlikely as my back isn&rsquo;t in a bad enough shape (yet).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also not willing to <a href="http://gregschlom.com/post/4555981908/standing-desk">make my own</a> version of a standing desk either, unless it was a better looking one :) So now what? Fear not. It turns out that if you stand for about 5 minutes every hour it already helps <strong>A LOT</strong>. So that I don&rsquo;t miss my standing breaks, I need a timer. An unobtrusive little app that sits in my taskbar and just alerts me at intervals to take a break and have a stand. Far be it for me to actually go looking for something that does this just how I want it. That sounds like too much work really. Thus I decided to turn it into a project for myself and write my own. I mean, how hard can it be?</p>

<p>Turns out: not so hard at all. After about an hour of hacking around with some PyQt I made this: <a href="https://github.com/Svenito/EasyTimer">https://github.com/Svenito/EasyTimer</a></p>

<p>It runs in the system tray, lets you set a custom timer period and then it pops up a window once the time expires. Not tested to destruction or particularily pretty, but it does what it needs to do. I&rsquo;ll need to tweak some dialogs and add some little features, but if you want to do yourself a favour and take regular breaks, grab the timer and give it a go.</p>

<p>Right, time for a stand me thinks&hellip;.</p>
