If you are reading this in the [future](http://i.imgur.com/pQSJhyw.png) you might 
be wondering why the posts are so old and why there are no recent ones.
The simple reason is that I have had nothing to add. "But how did you 
know this?" you ask. Well, I decided so. I've not been very good at adding 
content recently, for the simple reason that I have nothing much to write about.

You see it's quite simple really: I'm taking a step back from it all. I have a
full time job and a family. Both these things are time consuming and that 
leaves little time for me to tinker, hack, code, write whatever. So I've decided
that rather than shoe horn in half-assed attempts, I'd rather just take a step 
back. Going by the simple idion of 
["Anything worth doing, is worth doing right"](http://i.imgur.com/8maeRT0.jpg). That doesn't mean I will be giving up coding, hacking, whatever, 
completely, it just means I will be working on things that aren't really worth
writing about or that have already been written about a hundered times over.
Thus I will have little or nothing new to add to what is already available [out
there](http://www.google.com).

I could write about things from work, but the nature of my work doesn't really
[allow for that](http://i.imgur.com/ugA8LLd.gif). 
I don't want to write about opinions and thoughts, because that's
not what I am about. I've tried it before and I didn't enjoy it, nor was I 
[happy with the result](https://i.imgur.com/Ut25SPN.gif). 
So with this I will leave what is here for your reference and who knows, 
maybe one day there will be another post about something or other.

Time to kickback and [have a beer](http://i.imgur.com/rSxyNlO.gif) methinks.

Thanks for reading[.](https://i.imgur.com/vG96Num.gif)
