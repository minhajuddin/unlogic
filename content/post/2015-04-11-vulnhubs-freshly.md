This is my first writeup of a [Vulnhub](https://vulnhub.com) wargame: Freshly.

The challenge is:

    The goal of this challenge is to break into the machine via 
    the web and find the secret hidden in a sensitive file. 

Go grab the image and follow along.

First I need to determine the image's IP address and what services it is running:

{{< highlight console >}}

So I can see the host is at `192.168.56.103` and has ports *80, 443, and 8080*
open. Browsing to the address presents an animated gif. 

{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/qgkgkgg.png" >}}

My initial reaction is
to look at the source, but here I only see the `<img>` tag and the image filename.
The image filename could be useful later, but right now I see no use for it.

In that case let's see if the SSL port holds anything more interesting.

{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/wvHo8ru.png" >}}

Nice, looks like I'm getting somewhere. I follow this link to a wordpress site
which sells candy. Generally browsing the site I notice it's a Bitnami install
of a Wordpress site, running a few plugins. 

{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/SHEXup3.png" >}}

Before I start work on that, let me just see what's at port *8080*. Ah, it's a 
non *https* version of the wordpress site. I'm going to use that instead
of the *https* version to avoid any certificate issues and generally make life
a bit easier.

Using `wpscan` I can find out which of the installed plugins have vulnerabilities.

There's a few there, so I'll look at each on in turn to see how easy it is to
exploit, and what it might yield.

* Cart66 Lite <= 1.5.3 - SQL Injection 

    This requires the user to be logged in, and seeing as I don't have a login
    I won't get very far with this. 

* Google Analytics by Yoast 5.3.2 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) ###

    This requires admin access to the site, in order to configure the plugin.
    Another dead end.

* ProPlayer 4.7.9.1 - SQL Injection

    Not much luck with this. Although it doesn't require a login, I wasn't
    successful with getting anything out of it.

* WPtouch <= 3.6.6 - Unvalidated Open Redirect

    I doubt that an unvalidated redirect will be of much use here.
    
Ok, thinking cap back on.... I need a different angle of attack.

Revisiting the main wordpress site there is something a bit unusual.

{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/2ddRfdF.png" >}}

Did I miss something? Did I get done by a Jedi mindtrick? Let's see. I'll 
head back to the main site and try and find some other pages with *DirBuster*.

This is how I set it up

{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/auVPaoO.png" >}}

Using this list I got lucky and received two interesting hits after short while

{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/l647X5u.png" >}}

I've decided to hold back on on the `phpmyadmin` and investigate the `login.php`
first. This is what lies at the end of that URL

{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/c8aSx4n.png" >}}

I could just start attacking this with various SQLi strings, but the
beauty of attacking a virtual machine is that I can use tools without the fear
of breaking someone else's stuff. Roll out `sqlmap` and let's see what we can find:

{{< highlight console >}}
root@kali:~# sqlmap  -u "192.168.56.103/login.php" --data="user=1&password=1&s=Submit"

<snip>

POST parameter 'user' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N] y

<snip>

POST parameter 'password' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N] y

<snip>

[12:17:03] [INFO] the back-end DBMS is MySQL
web server operating system: Linux Ubuntu
web application technology: Apache 2.4.7, PHP 5.5.9
back-end DBMS: MySQL 5.0.11

{{< / highlight >}}

I've removed some of the output for clarity, but I can see
that there's possibility of a blind SQL injection for both `user` and
`password` and that it's a MySQL databse. Great. 
We can carry on using `sqlmap` to try and discover
what tables there are and if we can find any useful information.

First I'll get a list of databases on the system. This process takes a little while,
so when it asks "*do you want sqlmap to try to optimize value(s) for DBMS delay 
responses (option '--time-sec')? [Y/n]*" answer *YES*. It will be done quicker.

{{< / highlight >}}

It found seven databases, amongst which is an interesting one: `wordpress8080`. 
This seems to be the wordpress database, so I can start attacking that and see
if I can get the *admin* account. The `login` and `users` databases also look 
interesting, so let's take a look at those later. Additionally, if I can get
a login, especially an *admin* one, I could try to exploit the plugins later on.
After all, it does say there are multiple ways into this VM.

{{< / highlight >}}

The admin password for the wordpress site, excellent. As for the other tables,
I didn't find anything useful in them, so I won't post the output here. In that case
I might aswell just login to the wordpress site now. Basically I have full control 
of the wordpress site now, so what should I do? How does a PHP shell sound? Good?
Alright then... `cd /usr/share/webshells/php` and I'm going to use the 
`php-reverse-shell.php` and replace the site's *404* with that.

To do that I need to edit the theme in the admin section, and just
paste in the contents. The I need to open a listening `netcat` session and
browse to a non-existant page on the site.

I had to poke around the file system a bit to find this, but `/etc/passwd` is 
usually a *go-to* file if you get access to a system. Otherwise I'd still
be looking for the file now :)

So that's one way to do it.

This seems to be the most direct route in. It might be worth exploring the 
vulnerabilities on the plugins, but it's late now, so I'll save that for
another time.
