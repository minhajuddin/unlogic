Another day, another VM. Today it's the [SpyderSec Challenge](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/spydersec-challenge,128/)

So let me start it up and get on it. 

{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/nah3Wah.gif" >}}

As per usual I need the IP of the machine and
the services it has running (if any). Straight from the Unlogic Cookbook

Lucky me, only one service running, and it's good old http at that. 
Let's take a look at that page then:

[{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/IiA6MlY.png" >}}](http://i.imgur.com/IiA6MlY.png)

Without wasting much time, let's get to the clue hunting. First things first: check the source.
And there's clue number one, right between those script tags. It evals a function which seems to 
do some text processing. I'll open Firebug to see if that shows anything interesting, and sure
enough

{{< highlight javascript >}}
SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
    61:6c:65:72:74:28:27:6d:75:6c:64:65:72:2e:66:62:69:27:29:3b
{{< / highlight >}}

So that's the output from the eval. It throws an error because the result isn't valid
javascript. It seems to me as though it might be HEX. I'll put it through Burp's decoder and
sure enough it resolves to `a:l:e:r:t:(:':m:u:l:d:e:r:.:f:b:i:':):;`. That's not going to 
affect the page in any way, but I'm sure it's a clue. I'll note it down and carry on exploring.

The CSS contains a base64 encoded gif. I decided to investigate it by converting it to a file
and opening it in Gimp to examine it. Nothing much of interest there either. Hexdump also shows
nothing of note.

Ok then, apart from that there's nothing of interest in the source, so let me move onto the images on the page.
There's two images: `Challenge.png` and `SpyderSecLogo200.png`. On first glance they appear to
have nothing special about them, but once examined with `exiftool` I see something of interest

Hex strings are the order of the day here at SpyderSec. So back to Burp's decoder once more
after removing all the colons. The string decodes to another hex string. Same dance again, and
I get a typical base64 string, decode once more and be rewarded with `A!Vu~jtH#729sLA;h4%`. Which is
not encoded anymore. I make a note of it and carry on sleuthing.

Watch out, here comes the reliable `dirbuster`. Running it with the regular word list I discover the `v` subdirectory.
Browsing to that however merely responds with a `403 Forbidden` reply. I've not exhausted all the
nooks and crannies yet, there's still that cookie jar to poke at.

    Firebug -> Cookie tab -> URI /v/81JHPbvyEQ8729161jd6aKQ0N4/
    
Another clue.... leading me to a subdirectory under `v`. But that's also forbidden. Well, let
me just plug some of the data we've found so far into it. The random characters from the
exif data result in a 404, but the string from the javascript alert box however brings up a 
download dialog for a file called `mulder.fbi`.

A video file, which when I play it, is the song "Twilight Time" by "The Platters".

So here I hit another dead end. 

Let me think
{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/CbfWCmv.gif" >}}

I'll take inventory of the clues I have left now:

* A music video "Twilight time" titled *mulder.fbi*
* A seeming random string `A!Vu~jtH#729sLA;h4%`

So I ask myself, why is a video of a song named *mulder.fbi*? So I do a little research
and after searching for `the platters "twilight time" x files` I hit this section in a 
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Switch_(The_X-Files))

{{< highlight text >}}
When he puts it into the car stereo, it plays "Twilight Time" 
by The Platters. However, the agents take it to the Lone Gunmen, 
who discover that the disc contains a large quantity of encrypted data
{{< / highlight >}}

Well if that ain't a clue and a bit! Ok, so a little more research of what data you
can hide in a video file (search for `hiding files video mp4`) I am directed to a
[Lifehacker article](http://lifehacker.com/5771142/embed-a-truecrypt-volume-in-a-playable-video-file) 
describing the process of hiding Truecrypt volumes in MP4s. It mentions a few ways to 
detect such a volume in a video, but to be honest, I might as well just try and mount the volume.
That should be the easiest and quickest way to see if I am on the right track.

Sure enough, there's a volume in the video, but it needs a password. Well there's only
one unused piece of the puzzle left. I plug that in and there's our volume with the `flag.txt` file
which contains:

Well that was a nice challenge, especially the truecrypt volume in the MP4. That's
something new I learned from this. So thanks to [@SpyderSec](https://twitter.com/Spydersec) 
for the challenge, and thanks to you for stopping by to read this.
