Recently someone was talking about ordering Pizza from within
[Houdini](http://sidefx.com). I figured that it must be possible somehow.
I looked for an API and only found a US based, possibly out of date,
[API for Dominos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dominos) written in node.js.
However I needed one that worked with the UK version of the Dominos site.
So I began working on deconstructing the URLs that the Dominos site uses to get
menus, place orders and such, and started building a Python API around that.

So far I've got a few features working and am happy with the progress. Here's
a little video of how it works at this stage:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/17295.js" id="asciicast-17295" async></script>

Quite a bit to do still, but happy with the progress. I'm planning to write up how
I figured out all the API calls in order to interact with their backend, so stay
tuned for that. Follow on [Twitter](https://www.titter.com/binaryheadache) or
subscribe to the [RSS](http://unlogic.co.uk/feed.xml). The code will go up
on Github once it's more feature complete.

UPDATE: [it's on github](https://github.com/Svenito/dominos)
