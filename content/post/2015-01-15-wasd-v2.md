It arrived! I am now the proud owner of a WASD V2 mechanical keyboard. I ordered
it with brown MX switches, large centered font and light grey alphanumeric caps
and grey modifiers. I went of the 87 key version (no keypad) and also threw in a 
wrist rest to go with it.

Yes, this isn't the most stylish photo, plus there's no shoe in it either.

This is my first mechanical keyboard so I can't really compare it to anything.
That said, I very much love the feel of the keyboard and really enjoy typing on it.
It's solidly built and the keys are very well printed. Although I would
still like some [dolch keycaps](https://c1.staticflickr.com/7/6024/5886540547_abdb8c837f_z.jpg)
at some point in the future.

So thanks to WASD for shipping (2 weeks to the UK from point of ordering) such a
lovely keyboard to me. If you are after your own mechanical keyboard, you can't
go wrong with a WASD. I'm even tempted to get a CODE in the future maybe.
