I recently attended the [2014 London Hacker Olympics](http://thehackerolympics.com/) 
and had a blast. Amidst meeting some amazing people and having a lot of 
fun, our team managed to get first (second actually, as it was 0 indexed) place,
but only because it went into over time (even though it wasn't a draw), but who's bitter, 
right :). Either way, we won some awesome medals

Here's the score board at game close (we're Minor Zeta): [{{< figure src="http://i.imgur.com/ILD2eAn.jpg" >}}](http://i.imgur.com/ILD2eAn.jpg)

There was a lot of good competition and a lot of fluxuation on the scoreboard.
At times there wasn't much separating the top teams. 
Here's some of them hard at work:

The challenges were well thought out and balanced for coders and non coders alike.
I'll be there at the next one, will you? If so, I hope to see you there.

Anyway it was great and I hope that a few of the people who I told about this URL
are going to be reading this.
