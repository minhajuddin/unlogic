A few years ago, during a particularily active developing phase I had an idea for a project.
I toyed with it in my head and thought about issues I might encounter. Will it work
in this situation? Is it something that will be useful? How do I make feature X work?
Do I need it to also do this? The usual stuff. So much so I never got round to starting it.
I figured it's ok, because someone else has done it and executed in a much better way. 
Besides, who'd want to use it anyway, right? It would only have been me.

So now I am browsing my newsfeed and come across this: [https://flutterapp.com/](https://flutterapp.com/)

That's pretty much what I was aiming to make back then. Just goes to show you doesn't it,
if you have an idea just go make it happen. Just because someone else has made it doesn't
mean you shouldn't make it again if you want. Perhaps you can do it better? We're not all
innovators, but we are all capable to make something different and perhaps better.
If you can't quite figure out how to do it, don't let that stop you from at least making a start.
Do something, anything, to get started. That's the hard part. Once you get started don't force
yourself to make it work in a day, or a week even. Take your time, do it as long as you enjoy it.

So I'm going to take some of my own medicine and make a start on this project myself. It's been a
long time coming after all.
