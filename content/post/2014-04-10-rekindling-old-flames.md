Some time ago, some long, long time ago, I started working on a ray tracer. Yes, you're
right, the world doesn't need another ray tracer. I wasn't writing another ray tracer though.
I was writing the ray tracer from [this book](http://www.raytracegroundup.com/). Well,
not line for line, but I was using it for the most part and just adjusting a few things
to my liking and style. Initially I started it because I was curious how these things
really work under the hood. The principles and concepts of a ray tracer weren't
foreign to me, but to actually implement one, component by component, that was new.
Then the project ground to a halt for what reason(s) I can't recall.

So fast forward today and, feeling somewhat ashamed about it, I've decided to revive the project and
post the code on github. Right now I need to make sure the build still works and
that my system has all the dependencies, after that I'll push the code to
[https://github.com/Svenito/lemon](https://github.com/Svenito/lemon) then I'll continue
building on the code from the book, chapter by chapter until, one day, Lemon will be complete.
