In a [previous post](http://unlogic.co.uk/2014/10/29/checking-in/) I wrote about how I use
my inbox as a TODO list. Since then I have received my Google Inbox invite and have now
been using Inbox exclusively to manage my email.

It works pretty much as I expected, which is great. The added bonus of its "Bundles" is
a nice touch, and it's pretty smart about putting email into those bundles. I'm using
it pretty much as I did my old inbox, but it's more tailored to my way of working, allowing
me to swipe the mail to archive, and optionally delete it, pin it, or file it into a different
bundle. Once a mail is in a bundle they get grouped together and appear in a single "block", making
your inbox less cluttered.

I have a few invites left for those who are interested, but by now I imagine anyone who wants
and invite, will have had one.
