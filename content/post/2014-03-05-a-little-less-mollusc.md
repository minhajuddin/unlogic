I've migrated once more... from Octopress to a pure Jekyll blog.
The main reason is that I almost borked the octopress version again and 
was struggling to get it fixed. This blog is much simpler and will be easier to
customise too.

UPDATE: I've also managed to add Disqus to this blog and port all the old comments 
to the new URLs, so all old comment threads are back with their posts.
