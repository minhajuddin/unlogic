			  <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 12, 2015</span>
			      <p>In a <a href="http://unlogic.co.uk/2014/10/29/checking-in/">previous post</a> I wrote about how I use
my inbox as a TODO list. Since then I have received my Google Inbox invite and have now
been using Inbox exclusively to manage my email.</p>

<p>It works pretty much as I expected, which is great. The added bonus of its &ldquo;Bundles&rdquo; is
a nice touch, and it&rsquo;s pretty smart about putting email into those bundles. I&rsquo;m using
it pretty much as I did my old inbox, but it&rsquo;s more tailored to my way of working, allowing
me to swipe the mail to archive, and optionally delete it, pin it, or file it into a different
bundle. Once a mail is in a bundle they get grouped together and appear in a single &ldquo;block&rdquo;, making
your inbox less cluttered.</p>

<p>I have a few invites left for those who are interested, but by now I imagine anyone who wants
and invite, will have had one.</p>
