			 	<h1>Burnmail: temporary mail forwarding</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Fri, May 29, 2015</span>
			      

<p>A while back I got curious about how easy it would be to setup a temporary
email forwarding service, akin to <a href="https://meltmail.com/">Meltmail</a>. So I got
to it and made it.</p>

<p>In essence you will create a temporary email address that will forward all
mail it receives to your inbox. Once it expires, it drops all incoming mail.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty much ready now, hence why I am posting about it.</p>

<p>The differences between Burnmail (yeah, best I could do for now) and other
services is:</p>

<ul>
<li>forwarding can be expired by time or by number of received mails</li>
<li>all tasks are accomplished through email. There&rsquo;s no web interface</li>
<li>forwarding address is based on your original address with a short, random
string appended, to make it easy to remember.</li>
<li>addreses are also easy to type on a mobile device,
as the extra string consists of digits and lowercase chars only.</li>
<li>commands are forgiving and short</li>
</ul>

<p>The plan is to clean up the code and then release that on Github, but in the
meantime feel free to make use of it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to use it:</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-burnmail-address:e52eba2da256b91bcb5838bbad42c991">Creating a new Burnmail address</h2>

<p>To create a new Burnmail address, send an email to <a href="mailto:burn@kthnxbai.co.uk">burn@kthnxbai.co.uk</a>,
from the address that you want your Burnmail forwarded to. In the subject
you need to specify the expiration term. The following commands are valid:</p>

<pre><code>* time [n] - n is 3, 6, 12, 24, or 48 hours. It will automatically
  select the closest value to the one you specify.
* uses [n] - n is between 1 and 30. It will be automatically capped to 30.
</code></pre>

<p>By using the <code>time</code> command you will create an address that expires after <code>n</code>
hours. The <code>uses</code> command creates an address that expires after <code>n</code> emails have
been received through that address.</p>

<p>Once your forwarder has been set up, you will receive a confirmation email with
your Burnmaill address. Check your spam folder just in case.</p>

<h2 id="getting-a-list-of-emails:e52eba2da256b91bcb5838bbad42c991">Getting a list of emails</h2>

<p>To get a list of your current Burnmail addresses for an email address,
send an email to <a href="mailto:burn@kthnxbai.co.uk">burn@kthnxbai.co.uk</a> with the subject <code>stat</code>.
An email listing all your current forwarders for that address and their
expiration terms will be sent to you.</p>

<h2 id="deleting-burnmail:e52eba2da256b91bcb5838bbad42c991">Deleting Burnmail</h2>

<p>To delete a Burnmail send an email to <a href="mailto:burn@kthnxbai.co.uk">burn@kthnxbai.co.uk</a> with the subject
<code>kill address</code>, where <code>address</code> is the burnmail address to kill.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts:e52eba2da256b91bcb5838bbad42c991">Thoughts?</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now. Make sure to check your spam folder if you aren&rsquo;t
receiving any mail.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions for features, or notice something broken,
please let me know.</p>

<p>Also bear in mind that it&rsquo;s early days so there might be bugs.</p>
