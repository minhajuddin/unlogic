      <description>A few years ago, during a particularily active developing phase I had an idea for a project. I toyed with it in my head and thought about issues I might encounter. Will it work in this situation? Is it something that will be useful? How do I make feature X work? Do I need it to also do this? The usual stuff. So much so I never got round to starting it.</description>
