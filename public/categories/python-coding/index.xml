      <description>A very quick post about sorting a list of objects in python. Suppose you have a list of same objects and you wish to sort them based on one of these attributes, perhaps a return value from a method. There&amp;rsquo;s a really nice way to do it in place: if sort_by == &amp;#39;name&amp;#39;: people.sort(key=lambda x: str(x.get_name()), reverse=reverse) elif sort_by == &amp;#39;age&amp;#39;: people.sort(key=lambda x: x.get_age(), reverse=reverse) As you can see I wrapped the get_name call in a str() because in this case it was returning something else.</description>
