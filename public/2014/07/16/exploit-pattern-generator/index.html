			 	<h1>Exploit pattern generator</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Wed, Jul 16, 2014</span>
			      <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with various stack exploits and have made a fair bit
of use of metasploit&rsquo;s pattern generation and search tools in order to find
EIP overwrite locations in an overflow string. This works very well indeed,
but I had a couple of issues: Firstly I had to have my Kali (or whatever
pentest distro) VM running. Secondly running the scripts was very slow. Go on
give them a go.</p>

<p>I was told about <a href="https://github.com/longld/peda">peda</a> which is a
Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB. This is great, but I am playing
some war games on either virtual machines or remote boxes where I can&rsquo;t install
things like this. And I didn&rsquo;t want to have to copy binaries around all the time
either. So I looked for some alternatives. There were (unsurprisingly) quite
a few, but they were in Perl or Ruby. I was seeking a Python implementation.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Svenito/exploit-pattern">So I rolled my own</a></p>

<p>It will generate a pattern exactly like the Metasploit one up to a maximum of
20280 characters in length. Usage is dead simple. To generate a pattern just
supply the desired length:</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #272822"><pre style="line-height: 125%">$&gt; pattern.py 100
Aa0Aa0Aa1Aa1Aa2Aa2Aa3Aa3Aa4Aa4Aa5Aa5Aa6Aa6Aa7Aa7Aa8Aa8Aa9Aa9Ab0Ab0Ab1Ab1Ab2Ab
2Ab3Ab3Ab4Ab4Ab5Ab5Ab6A
</pre></div>


<p>And to search for a pattern:</p>

<div class="highlight" style="background: #272822"><pre style="line-height: 125%">$&gt; pattern.py Bf4
Pattern Bf4 first occurrence at position 942 in pattern.
$&gt; pattern.py Bf4B
Pattern Bf4B first occurrence at position 942 in pattern.
$&gt; pattern.py 0x42346642
Pattern 0x42346642 first occurrence at position 942 in pattern.
</pre></div>


<p>As you can see it converts the hex representation to the correct pattern. The
position is <strong>0</strong>(zero) indexed. I&rsquo;ll have to double check how Metasploit&rsquo;s version
returns the offset to match that.</p>

<p>Not sure how often you need a pattern above 20k characters, but if you do,
let me know and I&rsquo;ll work on it.</p>
