			 	<h1>Checking in</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 29, 2014</span>
			      <p>Just wanted to write a post to indicate that I am still around and also write about
something: How I use Gmail as my to-do list.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not usually one to write about things like this, because I personally don&rsquo;t
think they are that special, but after having a number of people marvel at
my Gmail inbox, I decided that I might as well write it down to share with anyone
else who might be interested.</p>

<p>As you well know Gmail has an inbox where all your mail comes in. From what I see
this is where most people keep their mail and that&rsquo;s fine. However I get mail
that needs to be actioned. Be that a renewal, or a shipping notification that I
need to keep around until my item arrives, or even just a reply to a personal mail.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used to-do managers like Any.do but they add overhead to the the process, so
I&rsquo;ve managed to stream line the process using the archive function. It basically goes
like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anything I don&rsquo;t care about gets deleted straight away.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s something important that I need to keep I can add a label or star and
archive it.</li>
<li>If I need to action it (reply, visit a site etc) it stays in my inbox</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a shipping notification/receipt I keep it in the inbox until I have the item
and am happy with it. This serves two purposes 1) it reminds me what I am expecting
and 2) lets me find the invoice quickly in case of returns</li>
<li>Once I have actioned an item it gets archived.</li>
</ul>

<p>This way I have an empty inbox bar items that I actually care about. This adds
very little overhead in terms of keeping track of things that need to be done.</p>

<p>Sure, this won&rsquo;t work if you need a reminder to get something done at 10am, but
I find we live in our inboxes so much that generally you will see these prompts
more often than you think. The added bonus is that you don&rsquo;t have a massive cluttered
inbox and important items are never far away.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that it doesn&rsquo;t replace a fully fledged to-do list/reminder app, but
it does the job very well for me, and getting my inbox zerod out is even more of
a push to take care of things. Plus you are never really going to be in a position
where you simply forgot to reply because you thought you already had done so. Or
you forgot to reply because you lost the email in the huge list of other mail you
have sitting in your inbox.</p>

<p>I am curious to see how Google&rsquo;s new Inbox will work for me, but right now I am
still waiting on my invite.</p>
