			      <p>Some time ago, some long, long time ago, I started working on a ray tracer. Yes, you&rsquo;re
right, the world doesn&rsquo;t need another ray tracer. I wasn&rsquo;t writing another ray tracer though.
I was writing the ray tracer from <a href="http://www.raytracegroundup.com/">this book</a>. Well,
not line for line, but I was using it for the most part and just adjusting a few things
to my liking and style. Initially I started it because I was curious how these things
really work under the hood. The principles and concepts of a ray tracer weren&rsquo;t
foreign to me, but to actually implement one, component by component, that was new.
Then the project ground to a halt for what reason(s) I can&rsquo;t recall.</p>

<p>So fast forward today and, feeling somewhat ashamed about it, I&rsquo;ve decided to revive the project and
post the code on github. Right now I need to make sure the build still works and
that my system has all the dependencies, after that I&rsquo;ll push the code to
<a href="https://github.com/Svenito/lemon">https://github.com/Svenito/lemon</a> then I&rsquo;ll continue
building on the code from the book, chapter by chapter until, one day, Lemon will be complete.</p>
