  <h3 class="h2 post-title">[dis]like </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Isn&rsquo;t it just like me to start a new year with a post titled &ldquo;[dis]like&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s not as bad as it sounds. I want to write about coding challenge sites and what I like and dislike about them, specifically regarding Python challenges. What I Like I take part in coding challenges regularily for various reasons and I get a great deal of benefit from them. Albeit some challenges are a bit contrived, they do offer some great practice in problem solving and writing clean code.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Checking in </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Just wanted to write a post to indicate that I am still around and also write about something: How I use Gmail as my to-do list. I&rsquo;m not usually one to write about things like this, because I personally don&rsquo;t think they are that special, but after having a number of people marvel at my Gmail inbox, I decided that I might as well write it down to share with anyone else who might be interested.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Why it will be quiet </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">If you are reading this in the future you might be wondering why the posts are so old and why there are no recent ones. The simple reason is that I have had nothing to add. &ldquo;But how did you know this?&rdquo; you ask. Well, I decided so. I&rsquo;ve not been very good at adding content recently, for the simple reason that I have nothing much to write about. You see it&rsquo;s quite simple really: I&rsquo;m taking a step back from it all.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">nmap&#39;s idle scan with scapy </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">If you&rsquo;ve used nmap before you are probably familiar with its idle scan feature. Should you not be, go and skim the docs. I&rsquo;ll quickly cover the basics here anyway. Basically it will allow us to conduct a port scan of a remote host without revealing our IP address. This is done by making use of the fact that IP IDs are sequential. The images below (courtesy of the namp project documentation) explain this very well.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Exploit pattern generator </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I&rsquo;ve been playing around with various stack exploits and have made a fair bit of use of metasploit&rsquo;s pattern generation and search tools in order to find EIP overwrite locations in an overflow string. This works very well indeed, but I had a couple of issues: Firstly I had to have my Kali (or whatever pentest distro) VM running. Secondly running the scripts was very slow. Go on give them a go.</p>
