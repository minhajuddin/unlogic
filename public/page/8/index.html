  <p class="post-summary">On Exploit Exercises you can find a number of CTF (Capture The Flag) VM images where you can practice your exploiting, hacking and general computer savviness. I&rsquo;ve been working my way through the Nebula machine and figured I might as well write up the process both for other&rsquo;s benefit if they get stuck, and also as a sort of diary for myself, so I can refer back to any info if I need to.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">On YAGNI and TEFNAR </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">You&rsquo;ve probably heard of YAGNI but not of TEFNAR. To recap YAGNI stands for You Ain&rsquo;t Gonna Need It and refers to the development principle of that you shouldn&rsquo;t write a feature that no one has asked for in the first place as it&rsquo;s probably never going to be needed. Instead wait until it&rsquo;s a requirement and implement it then. This saves wasted effort and keeps the code base clean and as small as possible.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Fixing Kali VM after dist-upgrade </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I just did a apt-get dist-upgrade to bump up to Kali 1.0.7. I&rsquo;ve got it running on VirtualBox, and after it booted back up all the VBoxAddition features were gone and the keyboard and mouse in X no longer worked. GRUB was fine however. Poking around the logs a little I discovered some issues with the mouse driver. Perhaps that was it, but why? Long story short it took quite a bit of digging, but I eventually managed to fix it.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">London Hacker Olympics 2014 </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">I recently attended the 2014 London Hacker Olympics and had a blast. Amidst meeting some amazing people and having a lot of fun, our team managed to get first (second actually, as it was 0 indexed) place, but only because it went into over time (even though it wasn&rsquo;t a draw), but who&rsquo;s bitter, right :). Either way, we won some awesome medals Here&rsquo;s the score board at game close (we&rsquo;re Minor Zeta): There was a lot of good competition and a lot of fluxuation on the scoreboard.</p>
