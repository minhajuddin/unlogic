      <description>Recently I setup a project that uses CMake as its build tool and googletest as a unit test framework. As is common place I wanted to make sure that my tests cover as much of the code as possible, so I went and grabbed the trusty gcov/lcov to analyse the tests only to find it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as I expected. I should mention this is the first time I have used CMake aswell as googletest.</description>
