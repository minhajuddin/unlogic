      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve used nmap before you are probably familiar with its idle scan feature. Should you not be, go and skim the docs. I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly cover the basics here anyway. Basically it will allow us to conduct a port scan of a remote host without revealing our IP address. This is done by making use of the fact that IP IDs are sequential. The images below (courtesy of the namp project documentation) explain this very well.</description>
