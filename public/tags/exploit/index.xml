      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with various stack exploits and have made a fair bit of use of metasploit&amp;rsquo;s pattern generation and search tools in order to find EIP overwrite locations in an overflow string. This works very well indeed, but I had a couple of issues: Firstly I had to have my Kali (or whatever pentest distro) VM running. Secondly running the scripts was very slow. Go on give them a go.</description>
