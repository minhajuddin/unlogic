      <description>Recently someone was talking about ordering Pizza from within Houdini. I figured that it must be possible somehow. I looked for an API and only found a US based, possibly out of date, API for Dominos written in node.js. However I needed one that worked with the UK version of the Dominos site. So I began working on deconstructing the URLs that the Dominos site uses to get menus, place orders and such, and started building a Python API around that.</description>
