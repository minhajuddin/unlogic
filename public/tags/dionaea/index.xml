      <description>I recently setup a dionaea honeypot on my Raspberry Pi and after tweaking and configuring it for a few days have now got a working setup. It&amp;rsquo;s a low interaction honeypot aimed to capture malware rather than ssh bruteforce attacks. I plan to leave it online for a week or a month, and the analyse the stats and see what it managed to collect. So far it&amp;rsquo;s mostly conficker variants, but there&amp;rsquo;s a suprising (to me) large number of infected machines out there.</description>
