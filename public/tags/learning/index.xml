      <description>Carrying on with the series, here&amp;rsquo;s how I solved Project Euler&amp;rsquo;s problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers Problem 2 Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to poke at Rust a little bit. And what better way to get acquainted with a new language than to solve some problems with it? And seeing as there&amp;rsquo;s not always a suitably simple problem handy, I&amp;rsquo;ve picked some problems from Project Euler to tackle. I am using Rust 1.0.0Alpha in this post. The first problem is: Multiples of 3 and 5 Problem 1 If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9.</description>
