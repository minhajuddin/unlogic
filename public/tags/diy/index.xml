      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve written here, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I haven&amp;rsquo;t been busy. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a DIY version of Speidel&amp;rsquo;s Braumeister and the software side of things has come along quite nicely. The idea is to have a Raspberry Pi controlled beer brewing system for cooking the wort across a temperature profile. Much like the Braumeister, or Grainfather style brewers. A probe monitors the temperature and will switch the heating on and off to maintain the current temperature.</description>
