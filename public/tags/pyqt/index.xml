      <description>This is just a quick post to show you how to display animated gifs in PyQt. It&amp;rsquo;s a straightforward process and by the end I will give you a class that wraps up the work for you. The way we&amp;rsquo;re going to approach this is by using a QLabel to render a QMovie. Assuming we have our gif (anim.gif) we need to load it into a QMovie and set it on the QLabel.</description>

      <title>Sitting is bad</title>

      <description>So the internet has recently been telling me that sitting is bad. Really bad. Well only if you sit for long periods of time. At my office it is very unlikely that they will be willing to furnish me with a standing desk unless my doctor tells them to. The latter also being unlikely as my back isn&amp;rsquo;t in a bad enough shape (yet). I&amp;rsquo;m also not willing to make my own version of a standing desk either, unless it was a better looking one :) So now what?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I needed to make a PyQt app where the &lt;strong&gt;window&lt;/strong&gt; is the shape of an image and doesn’t have a border. I say needed, that’s not strictly true, more like wanted to because it’d be more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
