      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to try out and work with the DK2 and the Samsung GearVR, and while both do what they do really well, I much prefer my experience with the GearVR. This isn&amp;rsquo;t down to a technical advantage like improved resolution, or the way it looks, it&amp;rsquo;s about the experience. I&amp;rsquo;ve strapped on the DK2 more times that I can remember, and I&amp;rsquo;ve set it up as many times too.</description>
