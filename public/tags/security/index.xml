      <description>Another day, another VM. Today it&amp;rsquo;s the SpyderSec Challenge So let me start it up and get on it. As per usual I need the IP of the machine and the services it has running (if any). Straight from the Unlogic Cookbook root@kali:~/Downloads# nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24 Starting Nmap 6.49BETA4 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2015-09-09 16:07 BST Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.1 Host is up (0.00039s latency). MAC Address: 0A:00:27:00:00:00 (Unknown) Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.100 Host is up (0.00017s latency).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been AFK for a while because of various reasons, but now I&amp;rsquo;m back and have managed to scrape a little time together to get on with some of Vulnhub&amp;rsquo;s new VMs. So let&amp;rsquo;s start with Nullbyte 1 Stage 1 I ran the usual service discovery and found: root@kali:~# nmap -sV 192.168.56.101 Starting Nmap 6.49BETA4 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2015-08-25 11:29 BST Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.101 Host is up (0.00057s latency).</description>

      <title>Honeypotting with Dionaea and Raspi</title>

      <description>I recently setup a dionaea honeypot on my Raspberry Pi and after tweaking and configuring it for a few days have now got a working setup. It&amp;rsquo;s a low interaction honeypot aimed to capture malware rather than ssh bruteforce attacks. I plan to leave it online for a week or a month, and the analyse the stats and see what it managed to collect. So far it&amp;rsquo;s mostly conficker variants, but there&amp;rsquo;s a suprising (to me) large number of infected machines out there.</description>

      <title>I made this: Purplescraper</title>

      <description>Had this script sitting around for a while and I figured I would clean it up a bit and share it. Get Purplescraper from my Github In short: you give it a starting directory, which will usually be where all the user directories are, and it will go get all .purple/accounts.xml files and extract any usernames and passwords it finds into a new file. Useful to make sure none of your sensitive data is available to other, non authorised users via slack file permissions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting strong passwords</title>
      <link>http://unlogic.co.uk/2015/04/14/revisiting-strong-passwords/</link>

      <description>Some time ago I wrote a post about strong passwords. That was three years ago and I figured I might as well revist what I wrote back then. Since then technology has moved on a lot, and the number of password breaches has increased, aswell as the number of reports mocking our poorly chosen passwords. As far as I am concerned, I am still using 15-18 random character passwords. I&amp;rsquo;m no longer lowercase only, but a mixture of upper, lower, digit, and punctuation.</description>

      <description>Next up we take on Narnia. This is a binary exploit centered wargame, so fire up your debuggers and let&amp;rsquo;s smash those stacks. For levels 5, 6, 7, and 8, see part 2 All levels are in /narnia and both the binary and the source are provided. I&amp;rsquo;ve not included the passwords here, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to work through the exercises yourself (or find them elsewhere :)) Level 00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt; int main(){ long val=0x41414141; char buf[20]; printf(&amp;quot;Correct val&amp;#39;s value from 0x41414141 -&amp;gt; 0xdeadbeef!\n&amp;quot;); printf(&amp;quot;Here is your chance: &amp;quot;); scanf(&amp;quot;%24s&amp;quot;,&amp;amp;buf); printf(&amp;quot;buf: %s\n&amp;quot;,buf); printf(&amp;quot;val: 0x%08x\n&amp;quot;,val); if(val==0xdeadbeef) system(&amp;quot;/bin/sh&amp;quot;); else { printf(&amp;quot;WAY OFF!!!!\n&amp;quot;); exit(1); } return 0; } Lines 8 and 9 tell us what we need to do.</description>

      <description>After having done Bandit, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to Leviathan. None of the levels have hints, so there won&amp;rsquo;t be any links to each of the levels. Without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s get cracking. Level 0 -&amp;gt; 1 Logging in with leviathan0:leviathan0 we take a quick look around to see what we have to work with, if anything leviathan0@melinda:~$ ls -la total 24 drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Nov 14 10:32 . drwxr-xr-x 167 root root 4096 Mar 21 06:46 ..</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s give Bandit from the overthewire war games a going over. I did this a while back, but never really wrote it up, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to do it again and write it up. Remember that you can copy and paste from all the asciinema videos below. Bandit is a CTF/wargame for beginners and a great intro to various linux tools as well. I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat the level summary for each post, instead there&amp;rsquo;s a link to the original page for each section.</description>

      <description>Continues on from Let&amp;rsquo;s crack Bandit Part 1 Level 15 -&amp;gt; 16 Level 15 Eventhough this is very similar to the previous level, it&amp;rsquo;s a little more complicated as we need to connect with SSL. The simplest way is using openssl with s_client. Once connected it&amp;rsquo;s the same dance as above bandit15@melinda:~$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:30001 depth=0 CN = li190-250.members.linode.com verify error:num=18:self signed certificate verify return:1 depth=0 CN = li190-250.members.linode.com verify return:1 BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr Correct!</description>

      <description>The InfoSec Institue is running a n00bsCTF, and I can&amp;rsquo;t resist a CTF really. Plus this will be a nice warmup for Hackyeaster 2015. So let&amp;rsquo;s jump on it and get some flags&amp;hellip; I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to get all of them, but I will be updating this post when I manage to solve some of the others. Level 01 http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/levelone.php May the source be with you, eh? Sounds to me like someone wants us to look at the page source.</description>

      <description>We all carry phones around that are connected to some of network at all times. Unless you are the truly paranoid or battery saving type, then there will be periods when your phone is dark. But even so, I often wonder what my phone is transmitting when I&amp;rsquo;m not using it, or even when I am using it. So in this series I plan on doing some investigation into what goes in and out of my phone.</description>

      <title>Strong passwords?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m just going around and updating the passwords to some of my online accounts, which was prompted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=no&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;u=http://www.dagensit.no/article2411857.ece&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article, I was wonderingwhat a good password really is. Not just in terms of security but also in terms of user friendliness.&lt;/p&gt;
