      <description>I was trying out the Kali Linux live build, and ran into an an issue where the lb build command would throw an error: chroot: failed to run command &#39;/usr/bin/env&#39;: No such file or directory Turns out this is a Debian bug that&amp;rsquo;s been around since 2013. Luckily the fix is straightforward. First follow the usual live build instructions and then make sure the Kali repo sources are set. Now in order to fix the issue we follow the instructions provided in this bug report.</description>

      <title>Fixing Kali VM after dist-upgrade</title>

      <description>I just did a apt-get dist-upgrade to bump up to Kali 1.0.7. I&amp;rsquo;ve got it running on VirtualBox, and after it booted back up all the VBoxAddition features were gone and the keyboard and mouse in X no longer worked. GRUB was fine however. Poking around the logs a little I discovered some issues with the mouse driver. Perhaps that was it, but why? Long story short it took quite a bit of digging, but I eventually managed to fix it.</description>
