      <description>On Exploit Exercises you can find a number of CTF (Capture The Flag) VM images where you can practice your exploiting, hacking and general computer savviness. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working my way through the Nebula machine and figured I might as well write up the process both for other&amp;rsquo;s benefit if they get stuck, and also as a sort of diary for myself, so I can refer back to any info if I need to.</description>
