      <description>&lt;p&gt;Piracy is rampant, or so certain media and copyright trolls would lead you to believe.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how true this is as I have no access to figures proving it either way, and it would
require me to define at what level copying copyrighted stuff becomes &lt;em&gt;rampant&lt;/em&gt;. Besides,
this is not really what I wanted to write about. I&amp;rsquo;m more interested in airing a few
thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve had about some of the things going on around piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
