      <description>I recently got hold of some malware that got snapped up by McAfee and stored in a bup file. Keen to take a look at it, I researched how to &amp;lsquo;unbup&amp;rsquo; files and found this page: http://blog.opensecurityresearch.com/2012/07/unbup-mcafee-bup-extractor-for-linux.html A slow bash script? A faster script in Perl? No, that won&amp;rsquo;t do. Rather than search for a Python implementation I decided to use this as an opportunity to write something, and thus my unbup.py was born.</description>
