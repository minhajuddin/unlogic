      <description>I recently attended the 2014 London Hacker Olympics and had a blast. Amidst meeting some amazing people and having a lot of fun, our team managed to get first (second actually, as it was 0 indexed) place, but only because it went into over time (even though it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a draw), but who&amp;rsquo;s bitter, right :). Either way, we won some awesome medals Here&amp;rsquo;s the score board at game close (we&amp;rsquo;re Minor Zeta): There was a lot of good competition and a lot of fluxuation on the scoreboard.</description>
