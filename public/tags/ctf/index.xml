      <description>The folks over at the Infosec Institue have released their second CTF. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I got on&amp;hellip; Level 01 In level 01 I am supposed to use the provided form to perform a cross site scripting exploit. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the form looks like: At first I might as well test how the form works. Entering something like test and www.test.com in the fields simply adds the supplied information to the column on the left.</description>

      <description>Another year, another Hacky Easter and a month, of fun, learning, and frustrations. All in all this was another great year and I&amp;rsquo;m already looking forward to 2016&amp;rsquo;s edition. I found this year&amp;rsquo;s challenges were a bit harder than last year, but I did my best. Challenge 01 I&amp;rsquo;m told to search out the password in the following image Taking note of the missing letters and rearranging them to spell HACKERZ I&amp;rsquo;ll enter that into the egg-o-matic and see what happens.</description>

      <description>This is my first writeup of a Vulnhub wargame: Freshly. The challenge is: The goal of this challenge is to break into the machine via the web and find the secret hidden in a sensitive file. Go grab the image and follow along. First I need to determine the image&amp;rsquo;s IP address and what services it is running: root@kali:~# nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24 Starting Nmap 6.47 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-04-10 18:19 BST Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.1 Host is up (0.00019s latency).</description>

      <description>Next up we take on Narnia. This is a binary exploit centered wargame, so fire up your debuggers and let&amp;rsquo;s smash those stacks. For levels 5, 6, 7, and 8, see part 2 All levels are in /narnia and both the binary and the source are provided. I&amp;rsquo;ve not included the passwords here, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to work through the exercises yourself (or find them elsewhere :)) Level 00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt; int main(){ long val=0x41414141; char buf[20]; printf(&amp;quot;Correct val&amp;#39;s value from 0x41414141 -&amp;gt; 0xdeadbeef!\n&amp;quot;); printf(&amp;quot;Here is your chance: &amp;quot;); scanf(&amp;quot;%24s&amp;quot;,&amp;amp;buf); printf(&amp;quot;buf: %s\n&amp;quot;,buf); printf(&amp;quot;val: 0x%08x\n&amp;quot;,val); if(val==0xdeadbeef) system(&amp;quot;/bin/sh&amp;quot;); else { printf(&amp;quot;WAY OFF!!!!\n&amp;quot;); exit(1); } return 0; } Lines 8 and 9 tell us what we need to do.</description>

      <description>After having done Bandit, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to Leviathan. None of the levels have hints, so there won&amp;rsquo;t be any links to each of the levels. Without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s get cracking. Level 0 -&amp;gt; 1 Logging in with leviathan0:leviathan0 we take a quick look around to see what we have to work with, if anything leviathan0@melinda:~$ ls -la total 24 drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Nov 14 10:32 . drwxr-xr-x 167 root root 4096 Mar 21 06:46 ..</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s give Bandit from the overthewire war games a going over. I did this a while back, but never really wrote it up, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to do it again and write it up. Remember that you can copy and paste from all the asciinema videos below. Bandit is a CTF/wargame for beginners and a great intro to various linux tools as well. I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat the level summary for each post, instead there&amp;rsquo;s a link to the original page for each section.</description>

      <description>Continues on from Let&amp;rsquo;s crack Bandit Part 1 Level 15 -&amp;gt; 16 Level 15 Eventhough this is very similar to the previous level, it&amp;rsquo;s a little more complicated as we need to connect with SSL. The simplest way is using openssl with s_client. Once connected it&amp;rsquo;s the same dance as above bandit15@melinda:~$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:30001 depth=0 CN = li190-250.members.linode.com verify error:num=18:self signed certificate verify return:1 depth=0 CN = li190-250.members.linode.com verify return:1 BfMYroe26WYalil77FoDi9qh59eK5xNr Correct!</description>

      <description>The InfoSec Institue is running a n00bsCTF, and I can&amp;rsquo;t resist a CTF really. Plus this will be a nice warmup for Hackyeaster 2015. So let&amp;rsquo;s jump on it and get some flags&amp;hellip; I haven&amp;rsquo;t managed to get all of them, but I will be updating this post when I manage to solve some of the others. Level 01 http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/levelone.php May the source be with you, eh? Sounds to me like someone wants us to look at the page source.</description>

      <description>On Exploit Exercises you can find a number of CTF (Capture The Flag) VM images where you can practice your exploiting, hacking and general computer savviness. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working my way through the Nebula machine and figured I might as well write up the process both for other&amp;rsquo;s benefit if they get stuck, and also as a sort of diary for myself, so I can refer back to any info if I need to.</description>
