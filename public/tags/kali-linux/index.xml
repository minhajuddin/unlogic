      <description>I was trying out the Kali Linux live build, and ran into an an issue where the lb build command would throw an error: chroot: failed to run command &#39;/usr/bin/env&#39;: No such file or directory Turns out this is a Debian bug that&amp;rsquo;s been around since 2013. Luckily the fix is straightforward. First follow the usual live build instructions and then make sure the Kali repo sources are set. Now in order to fix the issue we follow the instructions provided in this bug report.</description>
